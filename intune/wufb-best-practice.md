# Windows Update for Business Best Practice

## Why Windows Update for Business?
Windows Update for Business (WUfB) presents several distinct advantages over Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), particularly for organizations seeking flexibility, cloud integration, and reduced infrastructure costs. WUfB is inherently cloud-based, eliminating the need to maintain any on-premises infrastructure which can be both resource-intensive and costly. WUfB delivers updates directly from Microsoft, ensuring that devices receive the most current, secure, and appropriate updates as soon as they become available, and provides more granular control over the deployment of updates, enabling businesses to stage the delivery of updates based on business priorities. For businesses operating on a global scale, this means faster, more efficient update delivery without overwhelming network resources or disrupting business operations.

## Things to Consider before enabling WUfB
One of the most regular issues experienced when implementing WUfB are conflicts that can occur due to policies that are still being delivered via Group Policy, or ConfigMgr Client Settings.
