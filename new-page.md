# Own your own backups
[Corso](https://corsobackup.io/) is a free, secure, and open-source tool that protects your Microsoft 365 data, at low cost, by securely and efficiently backing up all business-critical data to object storage.

You can get started with Corso in [just a few minutes](https://corsobackup.io/docs/quickstart/) and you will be able to move your Microsoft 365 emails and data to your choice of object storage provider and location. Not only will Corso compress and deduplicated your data, it will also encrypt it with your keys. Corso also uses internal checksums to verify the integrity of your data.

Itâ€™s also possible to quickly verify and test your backups with Corso. You can restore user data in sandbox environments and accounts and perform filtered restores to just bring back subsets of data. Give it a try and [let us know what you think](https://discord.gg/63DTTSnuhT)!
