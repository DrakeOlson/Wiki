# Welcome to the WinAdmins Wiki!

Hello and welcome to the WinAdmins wiki! A place to share, and refine the knowledge that crops up overtime through general conversation in the WinAdmins Discord. Any member of our community is welcome to publish and share their knowledge here. You can login using your Discord authentication to ensure a seamless experience and to help minimize the creation of "yet another account"

## Who are the WinAdmins?

The [WinAdmins](https://winadmins.io) are a collection of IT professionals focused on enterprise administration of Microsoft-based environments, interested in information sharing through online chat, blogs, tweets, and conferences/meetups. We are, in short, a loosely formed community focused on helping others in managing IT environments. While our original focus was on the management of Microsoft Windows environments, we’ve grown to support each other in managing Mac, Mobile, Cloud, and all new emerging technologies.

## Becoming a Member

WinAdmins is a loosely formed organization – there is currently no official membership. You can find our community in our online chat room and you can find many of our resources on this website. If you’re looking for help, come ask for it; someone has probably been down your road before. If you’re looking to help or mentor, come offer it. If there’s something specific you’d like to contribute, please reach out to the organizers.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/windows-admins/Wiki) and submit a pull request to add a page, and amoderator will review the request. Our Discord server also has a dedicated channel for Wiki-related discussions, please feel free to ask questions in `#wiki-chat`.
